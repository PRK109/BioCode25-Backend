This is the server that externally runs the cnn for flower classification.
The model currently processes 5 types of flowers.

to run the server, cd into 
{
    classification_server
}

then run in terminal
{
    python server.py
}

there is a python file in this directory called "testing.py"
this has minimal functional code for making post requests to Interface
with the server. Currently it is set up to send over the "sf.jpg" file
which is a wikepedia image of a sunflower
